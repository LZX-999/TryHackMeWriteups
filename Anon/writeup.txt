1. run rustscan only port 22 and 21 is open which is ssh and ftp
2. Login to ftp via anonymous we see its literally the entire os file is available, navigating to home/meliodas we get the user flag
on first login we see a interesting folder called dontread, going inside we see its pgp file and a backup encrypted. Download the file
Crack the private.asc using john run pgp2john private.asc > j.txt, john j.txt we get the password its xbox360. do pgp --import private.asc and key in the pw, then we do pgp --decrypt backup.pgp
The file decrypted is the shadow file which contain hashed password of root, send it to hashcat by first saving the file with the root hash $6$07nYFaYf$F4VMaegmz7dKjsTukBLh6cP01iMmL7CiQDt1ycIm6a.bsOIBp0DwXVb9XI2EtULXJzBtaMZMNd2tV4uob5RVM0. Then we hashcat -m 1800 root_hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt, we get the password hikari.
SSH as root and get the root flag.
